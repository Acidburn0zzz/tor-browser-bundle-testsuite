Running the test suite
======================


Usage
-----

 $ ./tbb-testsuite [options] <tbb-file>...

The <tbb-file> can be:

- the path to a tbb tarball file.

- the path to a sha256sum file. In which case all tarballs listed in the
  sha256sum and compatible with the current platform will be tested.

- the URL of a tbb tarball, which will be downloaded before being tested.

- the URL of a sha256sum file, which will be downloaded. The gpg signature
  from file sha256sum.asc will also be downloaded and checked with the
  keyring selected with the --keyring option, unless the --no-gpgcheck
  option is used. All the tarballs listed in the sha256sum and compatible
  with the current platform will be downloaded, have their checksum
  checked and will be tested.


Available options
-----------------

--action=<name>::
        Select the action to be done. The default is to run the tests.
        See the section about actions for details.

--config=<file>::
        Select a configuration file. See the section about Configuration
        Files below.

--no-gpgcheck::
        Disable gpg check when downloading a sha256sum.txt file.

--keyring=<file>::
        Name of the keyring file used to check the gpg signature of a
        downloaded sha256sum.txt file. If the file is not an absolute
        path, then it is relative to the keyring directory.

--download-dir=<directory>::
        The directory where to store the files downloaded when a URL is
        given rather than a local path. If the file already exists in
        this directory, it is not downloaded again. If this option is
        not given, the files are downloaded in a temporary directory
        which is removed at the end of the tests.

--no-mozmill::
        Don't run mozmill tests.

--no-selenium::
        Don't run the Selenium tests.

--no-starttor::
        Don't start a tor daemon. If you use this option, you should
        already have a tor daemon running.

--tor-control-port=<port>::
        Select the tor control port number. Default is 9551.

--tor-socks-port=<port>::
        Select the tor socks port. Default is 9550.

--reports-dir=<directory>::
        Directory where the tests reports are saved.

--name=<name>::
        The name of the tests run. This is used as directory name to
        save the results inside the reports-dir. If not set, a random
        name is used.

--virtualenv=<directory>::
        Path to the virtualenv where selenium and mozmill are installed.
        The default is the 'virtualenv' directory created by the
        'setup-virtualenv' script.

--no-xvfb::
        Don't run the tests using a virtual frame buffer X server.

--resolution=<resolution>::
        When using xvfb, this sets the default resolution. The default
        is 1024x768.

--enable-tests=<test1,test2>::
        Only run the list of tests selected. When this option is not
        used, all tests are run. This option is useful when you are
        working on a new test and don't want to run all the test suite
        to try your new test.

--upload-to=<login@hostname>::
        Upload the tests reports to select host, with ssh.


Configuration Files
-------------------

In addition to setting options using command line arguments, it is
possible to set options using a configuration file and the --config
option. If the path given to the --config option is relative, it is
expected to be in the config directory.

The configuration file is a perl script which when evaluated should
return a hash containing the configuration. The options set by the
default configuration and command line arguments are available to this
script in the $option hash reference.


Selecting action
----------------

The --action option can be used to select the action to be done. The
following actions are available:

  run_tests::
        Run the tests, make a report, and update the reports index page.
        This is the default action.

  reports_index::
        Create an index page listing the tests reports.

  make_report::
        Regenerate the html report of a test run. You should use the
        --name option to select the test run.

  list_tests::
        List available tests and their descriptions.

  send_report::
        Upload a report to a remote host. The report name is selected
        with the --name option, and the remote host with the --upload-to.
        This action is also done as part of run_tests if the --upload-to
        option is defined.

  receive_report::
        Receive a report on stdin. Usually this action is run from an
        ssh authorized_keys file.

  update_authkeys::
        Update the ssh authorized_keys file with users defined in the
        'uploaders' option. You need to run this on a user account that
        will be receiving tests reports.
