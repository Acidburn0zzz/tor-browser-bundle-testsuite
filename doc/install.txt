Installation
============

This git repository is using git submodules. So before running the test
suite, you will need to run 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update'.

To run the test suite, you need perl and a few perl modules, python
virtualenv, and xvfb.

Those dependencies can be installed by running the 'install-deps' script
as root, which will install the needed packages. This script has been
tested on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Centos.

After installing the required dependencies, a python virtualenv needs
to be created with mozmill and selenium. This can be with the 'setup-virtualenv'
script.

Summary of installation instructions:

  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update
  $ sudo ./install-deps
  $ ./setup-virtualenv
