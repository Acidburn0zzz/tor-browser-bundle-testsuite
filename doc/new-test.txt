How to add a new test
=====================

The list of tests to be run by the test suite is defined in file
'TBBTestSuite/Tests.pm' in the '@tests' variable.

Each test is defined with the following properties:

name::
        The name of the test. For 'mozmill', 'selenium' and 'tor_bootstrap'
        tests this name is used to find the test filename.

type::
        The type of tests. This can be 'mozmill', 'selenium',
        'tor_bootstrap', or something else if you want to write the test
        in perl. In the later case, you need to define it in the
        '%test_types' variable.

descr::
        A short description.

fatal::
        If you set this to 1, when this test fail the following tests
        are not run.

pre::
        A reference to a perl subroutine that will be run before the
        test.

post::
        A reference to a perl subroutine that will be run after the
        test.

enable::
        A reference to a perl subroutine that should return false when
        the test should be skipped.


Adding a mozmill test
---------------------

To add a new test based on mozmill, you will add something like this in
'TBBTestSuite/Tests.pm':

----
    {
        name  => 'example-test',
        type  => 'mozmill',
        descr => 'Example mozmill test',
    },
----

The mozmill test files are stored in the directory
'mozmill/mozmill-tests/tbb-tests/'. The name of the file is the name
of the test with '.js' at the end.


Adding a selenium test
----------------------

To add a new test based on selenium webdriver, you will add something
like this in 'TBBTestSuite/Tests.pm':

----
    {
        name  => 'example-test',
        type  => 'selenium',
        descr => 'Example selenium test',
    },
----

The selenium test files are stored in the directory 'selenium-tests'.
The name of the file that will be executed is 'test_$name.py' (with
$name replaced by the test name).
